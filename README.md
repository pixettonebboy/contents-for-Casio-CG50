# Maths and physics contents-for-Casio-CG50
Content to put in the Casio FX-CG50 to take math and physics exams, complete for both the high school final exam and for university exams (I used it in engineering).

- Place in the appropriate folders depending on fisica/matematica;
- Examples must begin with "ES_"
- Photos must be in PNG format and should be 150-250 KB each.
- The files in "stuff" have to be unpacked in the right calculator folders. 

I recommend this site to choose the CAS to use: [CLICK HERE!](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/hp39/khicasioen.html#sec2)
